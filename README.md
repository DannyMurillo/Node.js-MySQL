# Node.js-MySQL

**Created Week 12 of the UCLA full stack Web Dev Coding Bootcamp.**

##To Start
- Clone the Repo to where you want the folder to be on your computer
- Copy the sql file into your MySql Pro editor to create the local database
- Make sure to run npm install "requirer" and "mysql"
- Run the command "node BamazonCustomerView.js"

* code should end after each purchase by the customer. 

##BamazonCustomerView.js

- This file prints the products into the bash/terminal window
- Then allows the customer to decide how many products they want and their total cost
    -  This goes through the database and checks to see if there is enough inventory 
    -  This also updates the database so however many products are bought it updates everything right away


## Technology Used
